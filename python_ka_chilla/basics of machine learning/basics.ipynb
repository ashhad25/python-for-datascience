Data is fed to these algorithms to train them, and on the basis of training, they build the model & perform a specific task."

    "### Classification\n",
    "A classification problem is used to identify specific categories of new observations based on one or more independent variables. Classification in machine learning can require two or more categories of a given data set. Therefore, it generates a probability score to assign the data into a specific category, such as spam or not spam, yes or no, disease or no disease, red or green, male or female, etc.\n",

    "Most machine learning algorithms assume equal data distribution. When the data distribution is not equal, it leads to imbalance. An imbalanced classification problem is a classification problem where the distribution of the dataset is skewed or biased. This method employs specialized techniques to change the composition of data samples. \n",
